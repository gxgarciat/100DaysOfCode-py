# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 ÷ 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5

# Write your code below this line 👇
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     main()
